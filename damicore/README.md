# DAMICORE

  DAMICORE is an easy-to-use clustering and classification tool.

  DAMICORE is a pipeline of algorithms which is agnostic to the type of data
thanks to NCD, a compressor-based metric which views any piece of data as
simply a string of bits. This is particularly well-suited for heterogenous
datasets, datasets with difficult characteristics extraction and text datasets.

## Dependencies

### Installation
* python 3.10
* igraph library (visit http://igraph.org/c for more informations)
* python-igraph (visit http://igraph.org/python for more informations)

### Execution

  DAMICORE relies on compressors to calculate the distance between a pair of
objects (files).

* gzip (available in almost all \*nix systems)
* bzip2 (available in almost all \*nix systems)

### Recommended

* FigTree (available in http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/)

## Usage

The simplest way to use DAMICORE is to provide as argument a directory
containing all files to be compared:

     $ ./damicore.py executable-functions/

This outputs a list of pairs of file name and corresponding cluster index.
For now we are lacking a good tool to visualize this clustering, but there are
other tools that might help. We can output intermediate steps into different
files for analysis:

     $ ./damicore.py executable-functions/ --ncd-output results/texts.phylip --format phylip \
     --tree-output results/texts.newick --graph-image results/texts.png \
     --output results/texts.clusters --compress gzip

This outputs the NCD matrix using PHYLIP format, the neighbor-joining tree in
Newick format (readable by FigTree), an image with a graph visualization and
the final clusters into another file.

By default, the script uses PPMd as compressor. If you don't have it installed,
try using gzip or bzip2:

     $ ./damicore.py executable-functions/ --compressor gzip

For more information on available options, see --help.
